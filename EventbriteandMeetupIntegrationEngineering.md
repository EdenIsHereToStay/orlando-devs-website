# How to Automate Event Synchronization Between Eventbrite and Meetup Using Zapier

Efficiently managing events across multiple platforms can be challenging. By integrating Eventbrite and Meetup using Zapier, you can streamline this process and minimize manual work. This guide outlines the steps to automate event creation, updates, and cancellations on Meetup when they occur on Eventbrite.

## Overview

### Purpose
This integration ensures that whenever you create, modify, or cancel an event on Eventbrite, the corresponding event on Meetup is automatically synchronized. This setup saves time and ensures your audience receives consistent event information.

### Requirements
- **Eventbrite Account**: Ensure you have access to your organization's Eventbrite account.
- **Meetup Account**: You need access to your Meetup group and the ability to manage events.
- **Zapier Account**: Sign up at [zapier.com](https://zapier.com/) if you haven’t already.
- **API Access Tokens**: Required for both Eventbrite and Meetup to authenticate actions.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Set Up Your Zapier Integration

1. **Log in to Zapier**: Access your Zapier account and click on **Create Zap**.

2. **Configure the Trigger (Eventbrite)**
   - **App & Event**: Select **Eventbrite** as the trigger app.
   - **Trigger Event**: Choose one of the following triggers based on your needs:
     - **New Event Published**: To create a new event on Meetup when a new Eventbrite event is published.
     - **Event Updated**: To update an existing Meetup event when changes are made on Eventbrite.
     - **Event Canceled**: To cancel the Meetup event when the Eventbrite event is canceled.
   - **Connect Your Account**: Log in to your Eventbrite account and allow Zapier to access it.
   - **Set Up Trigger**: Customize the trigger settings, such as filtering events based on specific criteria.
   - **Test Trigger**: Ensure that Zapier successfully pulls a sample event from your Eventbrite account.

3. **Configure the Action (Meetup)**
   - **App & Event**: Select **Webhooks by Zapier** (if using custom API requests) or choose a pre-built Meetup integration.
   - **Action Event**: Use **POST** for event creation and **PATCH** or **DELETE** for updates or cancellations.
   - **Set Up Action**:
     - **Method**: Select **POST**, **PATCH**, or **DELETE** based on the event type.
     - **URL**: For event creation: `https://api.meetup.com/{group_urlname}/events`. Replace `{group_urlname}` with your Meetup group's URL name.
     - **Headers**: Include:
       ```plaintext
       Authorization: Bearer YOUR_MEETUP_API_TOKEN
       Content-Type: application/json
       ```
     - **Data**: Use a JSON payload to map Eventbrite event details to Meetup. Example for creating an event:
       ```json
       {
         "name": "Sample Event Name",
         "description": "Sample Event Description",
         "time": 1680307200000,  // Example timestamp in milliseconds
         "duration": 7200000,   // Duration in milliseconds
         "venue_id": "123456789" // Optional: Meetup venue ID
       }
       ```
       Ensure to dynamically insert Eventbrite data into the JSON.

   - **Test Action**: Send a test request to ensure that the event is successfully created or updated on Meetup.

## Automation Tips

1. **Use Multiple Zaps**: You may need separate Zaps for event creation, updates, and cancellations to ensure full automation coverage.
2. **Error Handling**: Implement error checks in Zapier to handle API failures gracefully.
3. **Data Consistency**: Make sure to map fields accurately (e.g., converting Eventbrite’s time format to Meetup’s).

---

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. **Authentication Errors**: Verify your API tokens and permissions on both platforms.
2. **Data Mapping Issues**: Check that all required fields (like event name, description, and time) are properly mapped between Eventbrite and Meetup.
3. **API Limitations**: Be aware of any rate limits imposed by Eventbrite or Meetup's APIs that may affect your integration.
