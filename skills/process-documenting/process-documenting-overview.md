# **Building a Self-Documenting Development Process for the Orlando Devs Website Refresh**

## **Introduction**

The Orlando Devs Website Refresh Project is more than just a website overhaul; it’s an opportunity to build a collaborative, knowledge-rich environment that empowers developers of all levels to contribute, learn, and innovate. With a focus on dynamic documentation, the project team is developing a fully self-documenting process that captures development insights in real-time. By recording sessions, creating instructional content, and utilizing the Orlando Devs AI Engine, we aim to construct a robust, AI-optimized knowledge base that streamlines onboarding and fosters technical growth within our community.

This document serves as a guide for contributors, outlining the best practices for documenting development activities, from recording work sessions to generating knowledge base articles.

## **Objectives**

Our primary objective is to document and capture as much of the development process as possible in real-time, ensuring that:
- **All knowledge** generated within the project is preserved for future reference.
- **Team members** can create instructional content that is both accessible and instructional.
- **AI-driven content** is continually enriched with new skills and articles, enhancing the AI Engine’s capacity to support the Orlando Devs community.

## **Step-by-Step Documentation Process**

This guide will walk you through the process of recording, transcribing, documenting, and sharing your development work. By following these steps, you’ll contribute to a continuously improving knowledge base that serves our team and future contributors.

### **1. Screen Record Project Tasks**

Recording project tasks is at the core of our documentation process. Whenever you work on any aspect of the project—whether it’s individual coding, team brainstorming sessions, or collaborative coding sessions—capture it with a screen recording tool.

#### **Best Practices for Recording:**
- **Use a Microphone**: Narrate your process as you work, explaining what you’re doing and why. This will make the video more instructional.
- **Zoom Local Recording**: We recommend using Zoom’s local recording option for its simplicity and reliability.
- **Mind the Screen**: Be mindful of what’s displayed, ensuring no sensitive information is shown. However, the more transparent your process, the more valuable the content will be.

#### **Types of Recordable Tasks:**
- **Individual Development**: Show your coding approach, tool usage, debugging, and challenges.
- **Team Meetings and Collaborative Sessions**: Record brainstorming sessions, pair programming, and discussions on technical decisions.
- **Ad-hoc Problem Solving**: Capture how you troubleshoot unexpected challenges.

### **2. Proof and Transcribe the Recording**

Once you’ve completed a recording, review it for clarity, relevance, and coherence. Aim to produce a recording that is both concise and educational.

#### **Transcription Process:**
- **Use Otter.ai for Transcription**: Otter.ai is a powerful tool that generates accurate transcripts of recorded audio. It saves time and provides a clear text representation of your verbal explanations.

Having a transcript of your recording not only makes it easier to refer to specific points later but also provides a foundation for generating AI-enhanced content.

### **3. Generate an Instructional Article**

With the recording and transcript ready, the next step is to create an instructional article that explains the documented process. This article should be detailed enough to serve as a standalone guide, enabling new contributors to understand and replicate your approach.

#### **Using the O’Devs AI Engine to Generate Content**
- **Prompt the AI Engine**: Use the Orlando Devs Website Refresh Engineer AI to craft an article that explains the process in clear, editorial-style, technical content. This article should summarize the task, detail the process, and highlight best practices.
- **Save the Article**: Store the finished article in the `skills/web-application-developers-guide` directory within the repository. If this directory does not yet exist, create it. 

#### **Formatting Guidelines for the Instructional Article**
- **Title**: Include the task and skill focus in the title.
- **Sections**: Organize by introduction, process steps, and outcomes.
- **Clarity and Detail**: Use clear language and descriptive details to walk readers through the process.
  
This article can later be used as training material, providing structured guidance for other team members.

### **4. Create a Knowledge Base Skill-Article**

Following the instructional article, the next step is to generate a skill-focused knowledge base article. This document provides the AI Engine with structured knowledge, enhancing its ability to assist team members with similar tasks in the future.

#### **Creating the Skill-Article**
- **Generate Using AI**: Leverage the Orlando Devs Website Refresh Engineer AI to convert the process into a knowledge base Skill-Article.
- **Directory & Naming Conventions**: Save this article in the `skill` directory, titling it as `Skill-<skillName>forOrlandoDevsAiEngine.md`.
- **Content Focus**: The Skill-Article should be tailored to teach the AI Engine specific tasks or processes that enhance its functionality. 

#### **Outcome and Purpose**
This document serves as a skill-building tool for the AI, helping it to become more capable of assisting team members as they interact with the knowledge base.

---

### **5. Share Your Work in Slack**

After the instructional article and Skill-Article are complete, share your contributions in the Slack `#contributor-guides` channel. This ensures that team members can immediately access your resources and that the content is readily available for onboarding.

#### **Guidelines for Sharing:**
- **Post Title**: Include the topic covered.
- **Brief Description**: Summarize the process and main points.
- **Links**: Provide direct links to the instructional article, Skill-Article, and recorded video.
- **Attachment**: If possible, attach the video directly to the post. If the file size is too large, upload it to our shared cloud storage solution, and link to it in the post.

By sharing your content, you’re actively contributing to the collaborative learning process, making it easier for new contributors to understand and adopt our practices.

### **The Power of This Documentation Process**

This approach to documentation does more than capture technical tasks; it builds a community-focused, living repository of knowledge. By making these resources available in real-time, we’re not only enhancing our current project but also creating a long-term asset that will serve the Orlando Devs community well into the future.

By documenting your process with care, you’re making it easier for others to learn, adapt, and contribute. As our AI-powered knowledge base continues to grow, future contributors will have access to a comprehensive set of guides, insights, and tutorials that will smooth the onboarding process and foster a collaborative, knowledge-rich environment.
